I'm driving forwards but maybe I'm going backwards.
2 shots of dextromethaline, two swipes of cordomaxazine.
I have an itch, on the back of my head. I have an itch on the back of my, mind?
I can't keep my eyes open but I'm wide awake.
I can see the voices and hear the gravel.
I dial a number that doesn’t exist, but someone answers.
The moon knows something it won’t tell me.
My shadow moves before I do, and I don’t trust it.
The static on the radio spells out my name.
The clock ticks twice for every second.
My hands are shaking, but I’m standing still.
Dexatryptazine keeps me awake, but my dreams still chase me.
I open the fridge and find yesterday waiting for me.
Three caplets of Drexadine, and I can finally see the music.
The wind whispers secrets only I can hear.
I blink and the buildings rearrange themselves.
Every face I pass looks like someone I used to know.
I check the locks, and they check me back.
A train rumbles by, but I never see the tracks.
I don’t sleep, but I dream anyway.
The coffee tastes like déjà vu.
I chew a tab of Neurotherm and taste my childhood in ultraviolet.
My pulse is a drumbeat to a song I can’t remember.
Every neon sign flickers in code, but I lost the key.
The mirror shows me breathing when I hold my breath.
I left the house an hour ago—how am I still here?
Something is knocking, but there’s no door.
I press the elevator button, and the floor disappears.
The horizon shifts when I’m not looking.
The air is too thick, or maybe my lungs are too thin.
The city hums, and I hum back.
Every time I look away, the room changes shape.
My own footsteps sound like an army behind me.
I walk in circles but keep ending up somewhere new.
I don’t exist, but I sure feel real.
The Pharmacist slipped me a sample of Etheritol—now my past keeps calling me collect.
They told me Calmavex would quiet the noise—now I just hear the silence screaming.
Amnephrex erased my worries, but now I can’t remember what I was running from.
Popped a Restodrine—slept for ten minutes, aged ten years.
A Kinetizine capsule, and I swear my shadow just sighed.
Took a Noliprax to slow my thoughts—now they crawl like insects.
Professor said one Chimerol a day keeps the edges sharp—I’m bleeding from my reflection.
I wash down a Lunatol with a shot of Blacklightol—morning arrives in shades of static.
Two hits of Somnorex and my hands start moving before I tell them to.
A single drop of Phobezine, and every stranger knows my name.
